      What happens next
     </h2>

        <p>We have sent the licence for approval. This is usually done by the prison governor.</p>

        <p>Once the licence has been approved, we will automatically email the probation team to tell them. </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          If you need to make any changes
       </h2>

       <p>Only the initial appointment can be changed. For example, because a probation practitioner requests a different date or time. You can return to the service to edit this after it has been sent or approved.</p>
 
        <p>The licence will not need to be approved again.</p>
